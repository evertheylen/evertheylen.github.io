		<div class="fancy-title">About me</div>
		<p>I like to solve problems, usually with code. Currently, I'm studying for my 
		<a href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_52364384.htm">Master of Computer Science</a>,
		with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I live in Belgium. My hobbies include space, various sports
		and mountain hiking.
		</p>
		<p>I am fluent in Python and C++ (and combining both), and I have some experience in Go, Javascript, Java, Haskell and Prolog.
		I like open-source software, in particular Linux, Firefox, KDE and various libraries like Keras.
		When writing code I focus on simplicity, modularity and clear documentation.
		</p>

		<div class="fancy-title">Projects</div>
		<p>A small selection of my favorite projects:</p>
		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://notation-gcp.appspot.com/"><span class="project-title">Notation</span></a><span class="tag tag-js">js</span><span class="tag tag-go">go</span>
			<p>A small webapp to make drawings that are easy to embed in <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>. This allows me to add small
			drawings into my notes, which are mostly on Notion. Various tricks keep the overhead very low, and make
			the experience of drawing as smooth as possible.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://sparrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><span class="project-title">Sparrow</span></a><span class="tag tag-py">py</span>
			<p>Sparrow stands for Single Page Application Real-time Object Wrapper. Originally I created this in the context of a database project
			at university, which didn't allow any existing ORM libraries. Instead of resorting to writing SQL manually, I made my own. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://github.com/evertheylen/logicpy"><span class="project-title">logicpy</span></a><span class="tag tag-py">py</span>
			<p>This is a implementation of the concepts underlying Prolog and logic programming, in pure Python. I made this because
			the concept of logic programming seemed unlike anything I had ever done before, and wanted to bridge the gap with my usual
			way of programming. It's fully functional and has great Python integration.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://github.com/evertheylen/logicpy"><span class="project-title">IGMPv3 in Click</span></a><span class="tag tag-cpp">C++</span><span class="tag tag-py">py</span>
			<p>Made as a project for university, it's an almost complete implementation of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3376">IGMPv3</a> protocol
			for the <a href="https://github.com/kohler/click">Click modular router</a>. Network programming turned out to be pretty
			fun and I went much further than the original assignment. I also wrote a test framework in Python that wraps the Click router.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://github.com/evertheylen/TA_TO/tree/master/Helix"><span class="project-title">Helix</span></a><span class="tag tag-cpp">C++</span>
			<p>Made during my first year at university, it ended up surprisingly good. The basic premise is
			<i>fuzzy</i> matching of regular expressions in DNA. What makes it special is that by using
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree">suffix trees</a>, typical automata algorithms and ruthless optimization, we pushed the
			performance to extremes. Searching virtually any file (if it fits in memory) completes within milliseconds and can return thousands of matches.
