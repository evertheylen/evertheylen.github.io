Based on the quick start template for [Hugo theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). It uses [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) feature to load the theme.

## Update theme manually

Run:

```bash
hugo mod get -u github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3
hugo mod tidy
```

> This starter template has been configured with `v3` version of theme. Due to the limitation of Go module, once the `v4` or up version of theme is released, you need to update the theme manually. (Modifying `config/module.toml` file)
