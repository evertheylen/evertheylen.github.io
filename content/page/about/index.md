I like to solve problems, usually with code. I have a degree in [Computer Science](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_52364384.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving) and live in Belgium. When I'm not coding you can find me climbing, mountaineering or doing other sports. I am also interested in sustainability and space exploration.

I used to work at [MyCellHub](https://www.mycellhub.com/) and am currently working at my startup [Ecotarian](https://ecotarian.info/). Feel free to contact me at [evertheylen@gmail.com](mailto:evertheylen@gmail.com) if you have any questions!
