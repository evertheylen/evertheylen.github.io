I strongly believe the climate crisis is the most pressing problem of our time. Therefore, I want to actively work towards a more sustainable society.

I love coding and have a degree in [Computer Science](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_52364384.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving). I am based in Belgium. When I'm not coding you can find me climbing, mountaineering or doing other sports.

Feel free to contact me at [evertheylen@gmail.com](mailto:evertheylen@gmail.com) if you have any questions!

# Some projects

  - **[probox](https://github.com/evertheylen/probox)**: A tool to create secure, isolated development environments without sacrificing performance or ease of use.
  - **[logicpy](https://github.com/evertheylen/logicpy)**: An implementation of the concepts underlying Prolog and logic programming, in pure Python.
  - **[Notation](https://github.com/evertheylen/Notation)**: A small webapp to make drawings that are easy to embed in Notion. (no longer online)
  - **[Helix](https://github.com/evertheylen/TA_TO/tree/master/Helix)**: Fuzzy matching of regular expressions in DNA, university project.
  - I think developers still spend a *lot* of time on moving data around, so I wrote two ORMs: [Univocal](https://github.com/evertheylen/univocal) in Javascript and [Sparrow](https://github.com/evertheylen/Sparrow) in Python.
